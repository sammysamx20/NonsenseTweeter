# NonsenseTweeter
This application mimics the Twitter website (https://twitter.com). The application functions as a social media site where anyone can add whatever they would like to say.

# To start on localhost:
- npm install
- npm start

# To-Dos:
- Save data to a database. (So far it only saves locally to a json file so I need to use MongoDB or Firebase)
- Make accounts for users to use.
- Make it so a person can post as anonymous.
